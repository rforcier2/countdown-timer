# Countdown Timer
My first ReactJS Project. Making a countdown timer to any date a user inputs. 
This timer displays:
 - Days
 - Hours
 - Minutes
 - Seconds

 This project utilizes React's state management functionality to update the time every second, and update a new deadline whenever a user inputs and submits a new date.
 
## Live demo:
You can view a live demo [here](https://starlimeweb.com/countdown/)
## Updating the date
You may update the date using various methods including :
 - Using a string: December 01, 2018 or 1 December 2018
 - Using dashes: 12-01-2018
 - Using slashes: 12/01/2018
## Project Details:
This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app).
